    <p>In spoc yo can find a lot of things that are educative but so far i have learnt html and Css concepts and i can testify that it was the most helping thing ever. I learnt how to create paragraphs; how to include images, videos and audios in my website, i learnt how to change backgrounds, colors and other different valuable things that i am so sure i can be ableto create my own website without anyone helping and that is after just one week.</p>
